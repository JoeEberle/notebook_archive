      "Overview What is Diabetes What is diabetes? Diabetes happens when your body isn't able to take up sugar (glucose) into its cells and use it for energy. This results in a build up of extra sugar in your bloodstream. Poorly controlled diabetes can lead to serious consequences, causing damage to a wide range of your body's organs and tissues – including your heart, kidneys, eyes and nerves. Why is my blood glucose level high? How does this happen? The process of digestion includes breaking down the food you eat into various different nutrient sources. When you eat carbohydrates (for example, bread, rice, pasta), your body breaks this down into sugar (glucose). When glucose is in your bloodstream, it needs help – a \"key\" – to get into its final destination where it's used, which is inside your body's cells (cells make up your body's tissues and organs). This help or \"key\" is insulin. Insulin is a hormone made by your pancreas, an organ located behind your stomach. Your pancreas releases insulin into your bloodstream. Insulin acts as the “key” that unlocks the cell wall “door,” which allows glucose to enter your body’s cells. Glucose provides the “fuel” or energy tissues and organs need to properly function. If you have diabetes: Your pancreas doesn’t make any insulin or enough insulin. Or Your pancreas makes insulin but your body’s cells don’t respond to it and can’t use it as it normally should. If glucose can’t get into your body’s cells, it stays in your bloodstream and your blood glucose level rises. What are the different types of diabetes? The types of diabetes are: Type 1 diabetes : This type is an autoimmune disease, meaning your body attacks itself. In this case, the insulin-producing cells in your pancreas are destroyed. Up to 10% of people who have diabetes have type 1. It’s usually diagnosed in children and young adults (but can develop at any age). It was once better known as “juvenile” diabetes. People with type 1 diabetes need to take insulin every day. This is why it is also called insulin-dependent diabetes.\n",

Type 2 diabetes: With this type, your body either doesn’t make enough insulin or your body’s cells don’t respond normally to the insulin. This is the most common type of diabetes. Up to 95% of people with diabetes have type 2. It usually occurs in middle-aged and older people. Other common names for type 2 include adult-onset diabetes and insulin-resistant diabetes. Your parents or grandparents may have called it “having a touch of sugar.”\n",

Gestational diabetes: This type develops in some women during their pregnancy. Gestational diabetes usually goes away after pregnancy, however, if you have gestational diabetes you're at higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes later on in life. Less common types of diabetes include: Monogenic diabetes syndromes: These are rare inherited forms of diabetes accounting for up to 4% of all cases. Examples are neonatal diabetes and maturity-onset diabetes of the young.\n",

      "This is a form of diabetes specific to people with this disease. Drug or chemical-induced diabetes: Examples of this type happen after organ transplant, following HIV/AIDS treatment or are associated with glucocorticoid steroid use. Diabetes insipidus is a distinct rare condition that causes your kidneys to produce a large amount of urine. How common is diabetes? Some 34.2 million people of all ages – about 1 in 10 – have diabetes in the U.S. Some 7.3 million adults aged 18 and older (about 1 in 5) are unaware that they have diabetes (just under 3% of all U.S. adults). The number of people who are diagnosed with diabetes increases with age. More than 26% of adults age 65 and older (about 1 in 4) have diabetes. Who gets diabetes? What are the risk factors?

      "In men: Decreased sex drive, erectile dysfunction, decreased muscle strength. Type 1 diabetes symptoms: Symptoms can develop quickly – over a few weeks or months. Symptoms begin when you’re young – as a child, teen or young adult. Additional symptoms include nausea, vomiting or stomach pains and yeast infections or urinary tract infections. Type 2 diabetes and prediabetes symptoms: You may not have any symptoms at all or may not notice them since they develop slowly over several years. Symptoms usually begin to develop when you’re an adult, but prediabetes and type 2 diabetes is on the rise in all age groups. Gestational diabetes: You typically will not notice symptoms. Your obstetrician will test you for gestational diabetes between 24 and 28 weeks of your pregnancy. What are the complications of diabetes? If your blood glucose level remains high over a long period of time, your body’s tissues and organs can be seriously damaged. Some complications can be life-threatening over time.

      "tolerance test Less than 140 140-199 200 or higher Gestational diabetes tests: There are two blood glucose tests if you are pregnant. With a glucose challenge test, you drink a sugary liquid and your glucose level is checked one hour later. You don’t need to fast before this test. If this test shows a higher than normal level of glucose (over 140 ml/dL), an oral glucose tolerance test will follow (as described above). Type 1 diabetes: If your healthcare provider suspects type 1 diabetes, blood and urine samples will be collected and tested. The blood is checked for autoantibodies (an autoimmune sign that your body is attacking itself). The urine is checked for the presence of ketones (a sign your body is burning fat as its energy supply). These signs indicate type 1 diabetes. Who should be tested for diabetes? If you have symptoms or risk factors for diabetes, you should get tested. The earlier diabetes is found, the earlier management can begin and complications can be lessened or prevented. If a blood test determines you have prediabetes, you and your healthcare professional can work together to make lifestyle changes (e.g. weight loss, exercise, healthy diet) to prevent or delay developing type 2 diabetes. Additional specific testing advice based on risk factors: Testing for type 1 diabetes: Test in children and young adults who have a family history of diabetes. Less commonly, older adults may also develop type 1 diabetes. Therefore, testing in adults who come to the hospital and are found to be in diabetic ketoacidosis is important. Ketoacidosis a dangerous complication that can occur in people with type 1 diabetes.\n",

Testing for type 2 diabetes: Test adults age 45 or older, those between 19 and 44 who are overweight and have one or more risk factors, women who have had gestational diabetes, children between 10 and 18 who are overweight and have at least two risk factors for type 2 diabetes.\n",

      "Management and Treatment Managing Diabetes How is diabetes managed? Diabetes affects your whole body. To best manage diabetes, you’ll need to take steps to keep your risk factors under control and within the normal range, including: Keep your blood glucose levels as near to normal as possible by following a diet plan, taking prescribed medication and increasing your activity level.\n",
      "\n",
      "Maintain your blood cholesterol (HDL and LDL levels) and triglyceride levels as near the normal ranges as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Control your blood pressure. Your blood pressure should not be over 140/90 mmHg. You hold the keys to managing your diabetes by: Planning what you eat and following a healthy meal plan. Follow a Mediterranean diet (vegetables, whole grains, beans, fruits, healthy fats, low sugar) or Dash diet. These diets are high in nutrition and fiber and low in fats and calories. See a registered dietitian for help understanding nutrition and meal planning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exercising regularly. Try to exercise at least 30 minutes most days of the week. Walk, swim or find some activity you enjoy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Losing weight if you are overweight. Work with your healthcare team to develop a weight-loss plan.\n",

      "Taking medication and insulin, if prescribed, and closely following recommendations on how and when to take it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Monitoring your blood glucose and blood pressure levels at home.\n",
      "\n",
      "Keeping your appointments with your healthcare providers and having laboratory tests completed as ordered by your doctor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quitting smoking (if you smoke). You have a lot of control – on a day-to-day basis – in managing your diabetes! How do I check my blood glucose level? Why is this important? Checking your blood glucose level is important because the results help guide decisions about what to eat, your physical activity and any needed medication and insulin adjustments or additions. The most common way to check your blood glucose level is with a blood glucose meter. With this test, you prick the side of your finger, apply the drop of blood to a test strip, insert the strip into the meter and the meter will show your glucose level at that moment in time. Your healthcare provider will tell you how often you’ll need to check your glucose level. What is continuous glucose monitoring? Advancements in technology have given us another way to monitor glucose levels. Continuous glucose monitoring uses a tiny sensor inserted under your skin. You don't need to prick your finger. Instead, the sensor measures your glucose and can display results anytime during the day or night. Ask your healthcare provider about continuous glucose monitors to see if this is an option for you. What should my blood glucose level be? Ask your healthcare team what your blood glucose level should be. They may have a specific target range for you. In general, though, most people try to keep their blood glucose levels at these targets: Before a meal: between 80 and 130 mg/dL.\n",
      "\n",

Over 40 medications have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of diabetes. It’s beyond the scope of this article to review all of these drugs. Instead, we’ll briefly review the main drug classes available, how they work and present the names of a few drugs in each class. Your healthcare team will decide if medication is right for you. If so, they’ll decide which specific drug(s) are best to treat your diabetes. Diabetes medication drug classes include: Sulfonylureas: These drugs lower blood glucose by causing the pancreas to release more insulin.

Discuss your specific questions and concerns with him or her. What insulin medications are approved to treat diabetes? There are many types of insulins for diabetes. If you need insulin, you healthcare team will discuss the different types and if they are to be combined with oral medications. To follow is a brief review of insulin types. Rapid-acting insulins: These insulins are taken 15 minutes before meals, they peak (when it best lowers blood glucose) at one hour and work for another two to four hours.

Examples include insulin glargine (Basaglar®, Lantus®, Toujeo®), insulin detemir (Levemir®) and insulin degludec (Tresiba®). There are insulins that are a combination of different insulins. There are also insulins that are combined with a GLP-1 receptor agonist medication (e.g. Xultophy®, Soliqua®). How is insulin taken? How many different ways are there to take insulin? Insulin is available in several different formats. You and your healthcare provider will decide which delivery method is right for you based on your preference, lifestyle, insulin needs and insurance plan. Here’s a quick review of available types. Needle and syringe : With this method, you’ll insert a needle into a vial of insulin, pull back the syringe and fill the needle with the proper dose of insulin. You’ll inject the insulin into your belly or thigh, buttocks or upper arm – rotating the injection spots. You may need to give yourself one or more shots a day to maintain your target blood glucose level.\n",

Insulin pump : Insulin pumps are small, computerized devices, about the size of a small cell phone that you wear on your belt, in your pocket, or under your clothes. They deliver rapid-acting insulin 24 hours a day through a small flexible tube called a cannula. The cannula is inserted under the skin using a needle. The needle is then removed leaving only the flexible tube under the skin. You replaces the cannula every two to three days. Another type of insulin pump is attached directly to your skin and does not use tubes.\n",

Jet injector: This is a needleless delivery method that uses high pressure to send a fine spray of insulin through your skin. Are there other treatment options for diabetes? Yes. There are two types of transplantations that might be an option for a select number of patients who have type 1 diabetes. A pancreas transplant is possible. However, getting an organ transplant requires taking immune-suppressing drugs for the rest of your life and dealing with the side effects of these drugs. However, if the transplant is successful, you’ll likely be able to stop taking insulin. Another type of transplant is a pancreatic islet transplant. In this transplant, clusters of islet cells (the cells that make insulin) are transplanted from an organ donor into your pancreas to replace those that have been destroyed. Another treatment under research for type 1 diabetes is immunotherapy. Since type 1 is an immune system disease, immunotherapy holds promise as a way to use medication to turn off the parts of the immune system that cause type 1 disease. Bariatric surgery is another treatment option that’s an indirect treatment for diabetes. Bariatric surgery is an option if you have type 2 diabetes, are obese (body mass index over 35) and considered a good candidate for this type of surgery. Much improved blood glucose levels are seen in people who have lost a significant amount of weight. Of course other medications are prescribed to treat any existing health problems that contribute to increasing your risk of developing diabetes. These conditions include high blood pressure, high cholesterol and other heart-related diseases.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prevention Can prediabetes, type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes be prevented? Although diabetes risk factors like family history and race can’t be changed, there are other risk factors that you do have some control over. Adopting some of the healthy lifestyle habits listed below can improve these modifiable risk factors and help to decrease your chances of getting diabetes: Eat a healthy diet, such as the Mediterranean or Dash diet. Keep a food diary and calorie count of everything you eat. Cutting 250 calories per day can help you lose ½ pound per week.\n",
      "\n",
      "Get physically active. Aim for 30 minutes a day at least five days a week. Start slow and work up to this amount or break up these minutes into more doable 10 minute segments. Walking is great exercise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lose weight if you are overweight. Don’t lose weight if you are pregnant, but check with your obstetrician about healthy weight gain during your pregnancy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lower your stress. Learn relaxation techniques, deep breathing exercises, mindful meditation, yoga and other helpful strategies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Limit alcohol intake. Men should drink no more than two alcoholic beverages a day; women should drink no more than one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Get an adequate amount of sleep (typically 7 to 9 hours).\n",
      "\n",
      "Quit smoking.\n",
      "\n",
      "Take medications – to manage existing risk factors for heart disease (e.g., high blood pressure, cholesterol) or to reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes – as directed by your healthcare provider.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you think you have symptoms of prediabetes, see your provider. Can type 1 diabetes be prevented? No. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease, meaning your body attacks itself. Scientists aren’t sure why someone’s body would attack itself. Other factors may be involved too, such as genetic changes. Can the long-term complications of diabetes be prevented? Chronic complications are responsible for most illness and death associated with diabetes. Chronic complications usually appear after several years of elevated blood sugars (hyperglycemia). Since patients with type 2 diabetes may have elevated blood sugars for several years before being diagnosed, these patients may have signs of complications at the time of diagnosis. The complications of diabetes have been described earlier in this article. Although the complications can be wide ranging and affect many organ systems, there are many basic principles of prevention that are shared in common. These include: Take your diabetes medications (pills and/or insulin) as prescribed by your doctor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Take all of your other medications to treat any risk factors (high blood pressure, high cholesterol, other heart-related problems and other health conditions) as directed by your doctor.\n",

      "Outlook / Prognosis What should I expect if I have been diagnosed with diabetes? If you have diabetes, the most important thing you can do is keep your blood glucose level within the target range recommended by your healthcare provider. In general, these targets are: Before a meal: between 80 and 130 mg/dL.\n",
      "\n",
      "About two hours after the start of a meal: less than 180 mg/dL. You will need to closely follow a treatment plan, which will likely include following a customized diet plan, exercising 30 minutes five times a week, quitting smoking, limiting alcohol and getting seven to nine hours of sleep a night. Always take your medications and insulin as instructed by your provider.\n"
